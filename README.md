**Natural Language Procesing Models for Technical Support**

From a business perspecitve, machine learning text classification algorithms are valuable when they structure and anlayze text in a cost-effective manner, thereby expediting business processes and decision-making processes. Entity idientification in technical support is critical to properly responding to and addressing technical issues. The affected application dictates the procedure to be followed for resolution.

The objective of this project is to compare different Machine Learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to classify technical support issues. The models take free-form text as input. Dataset was obtained from existing technical support cases. The project has two main components: pre-processing and application of NLP techniques; and, creation of models.
